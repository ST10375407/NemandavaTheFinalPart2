feedback.
In response to feedback, I made significant enhancements to the Sanele recipe application. Now, users are prompted to confirm before clearing recipe data, ensuring intentional actions. This update improves user experience by preventing accidental data loss. Additionally, the application handles new data entry seamlessly, providing a smooth workflow for users to enter and manage multiple recipes. These changes were implemented to prioritize user control, prevent data mishaps, and enhance the overall usability of the software. The README includes detailed instructions for compiling and running the software, a link to the GitHub repository, and a screenshot of the commit history up to the Part 2 tag, showcasing these improvements.
